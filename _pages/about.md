Hi there, this is Seungmin. I am a doctorate student at Stony Brook majoring in Data Science. Before Stony Brook, I received my bachelor's degree at [Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr), where I was honorably supervised by professor [Changwon Lim](https://sites.google.com/view/cwlim/members/professor). 

I'm posting some interesting parts of statistics, mathematics and data mining, so feel free to stay here! For now, what interests me is how to build a Bayesian model that is transparent, reliable and yet practical, which does not necessarily rely on Gradient Descent Algorithm. Any idea is welcome!

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
