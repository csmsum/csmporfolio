Hi there, this is Seungmin. I am a doctorate student at Stony Brook majoring in Data Science. Before Stony Brook, I received my bachelor's degree at [Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr), where I was honorably supervised by professor [Changwon Lim](https://sites.google.com/view/cwlim/members/professor).  

I'm posting some interesting parts of statistics, mathematics and data mining, so feel free to stay here! For now, what interests me is how to build a Bayesian model that is transparent, reliable and yet practical, which does not necessarily rely on Gradient Descent Algorithm. Any idea is welcome!

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com).
